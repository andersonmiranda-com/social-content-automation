## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The project requires API keys and other secrets to connect to external services.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    It is recommended to copy the `.env.example` file (if it exists) or create a new `.env` file manually.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Fill in the variables:**
    Open the `.env` file and add the necessary environment variables. The specific keys will depend on the services you use.

    **Example:**

    ```dotenv
    # .env
    # Credentials for external services
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    CLOUDINARY_URL="cloudinary://api_key:api_secret@cloud_name"
    LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN="..."
    ```
