"""
Main pipeline for publishing content to social media.

This pipeline orchestrates the process of:
1. Selecting content from a source (e.g., Google Sheets).
2. Generating a Canva design URL if needed.
3. Uploading the final image to a persistent store (Cloudinary).
4. Publishing the content to specified social media platforms.
5. Updating the status of the content to mark it as published.
